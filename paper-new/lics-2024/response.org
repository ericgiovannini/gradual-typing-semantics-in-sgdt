We thank the reviewers for their insightful feedback which will help
us improve the paper independent of the final decision here. We
perceive from the reviews that the main criticisms of the paper are in
the writing and are confident we can address these in revisions. We
first address the most pertinent technical and writing questions, and
then more minor ones. If we don't address a question below it is
because we believe the fix to it to be relatively simple.

To summarize, the most significant changes we plan to make in the
revisions are:
1. Expand on section 4.2 to more thoroughly motivate the need for our
   extensional and intensional models, e.g., lack of transitive
   reasoning and the need to reason about perturbations
2. Introduce the concrete model earlier to help motivate the abstract
   models and constructions.
3. Provide more background on the axioms for gradual typing
4. Clarify the key steps in the construction of the intensional and
   extensional model.
5. Fix the typos, and address the smaller points included below

* Reviewer 2 re-writing
*MAX:* Eric please make this more organized into distinct points.

Reviewer 2 says that the paper is difficult to follow and feels heavily
compressed. Reviewer 1 points out that Section 4.2 is the weakest in the
paper, and also asks important questions about our notion of extensional modelm
namely:
1.  Why is the idealized notion of extensional model not suitable for our semantics?
2.  Why can't we require transitivity in our notion of extensional model?
   
We believe that the main source of confusion
in the paper as it stands now is that the notions of extensional and
intensional model as introduced in Section 4.2 and defined in Section 5 are
introduced without first motivating why the concrete construction doesn't
satisfy the definition of an idealized model.

We intended for the paper to include material explaining this but we removed
it unintentionally while editing the paper, so we include the explanation below.

In short, the justification for the lack of transitive reasoning is that
the semantic model of term precision that we use (≾) is provably
*not transitive*, and neither is the *guarded definition* of weak
bisimilarity (≈). The argument is as follows: if a relation ~ on L A is

1. A congruence wrt θ: ▶_t (x t ~ y t) ⇒ θx ~ θy
2. Right-closed under delay: x ~ y ⇒ x ~ δ y
3. Transitive

Then by Löb induction you can show every element x satisfies x ~ fix
θ.  If the relation is also left-closed then this implies for any x,y
that x ~ fix θ and fix θ ~ y and so by transitivity x ~ y and the
relation is trivial. But these relations (≾, ≈) satisfy (1) and (2)
but are non-trivial so they are not transitive.

This does not contradict that Capretta's delay monad has a transitive
notion of weak bisimilarity. Capretta's weak bisimilarity should be
equivalent to the global (i.e., ∀k) version of our guarded weak
bisimilarity. This global relation therefore should be transitive. So
we almost get out an idealized model this way, but only for
"clock-irrelevant" types, which are essentially the ones that do not
use Dyn. However we need the weaker formulation of an extensional
model in order to get a compositional construction that models Dyn,
which is obviously central to gradual typing.

Finally, as briefly mentioned (378-381) transitive reasoning is not an
essential component of graduality, for instance it was not in the
original SNAPL 2015 formulation of the gradual guarantee. It was only
added in New and Licata's work which used models that supported
transitive reasoning.


* R1 why posets?
Reviewer 1 asks why the objects in our concrete model have a notion of ordering,
as opposed to just being types along with a weak bisimilarity relation. There
are two potential interpretations of this question. The first is that the reviewer
is asking why an ordering relation is needed on objects, to which our response
is that we are trying to model the term precision ordering of gradual typing.
In particular, the abstract models include a notion of commutative squares
between morphisms, and the way we instantiate in the concrete setting is by
equipping the objects with a partial order which then extends to the morphisms,
i.e., we define a commuting square f ⊑ g as "if x ≤ y then f x ≤ g y".

The second interpretation of the question about the ordering is that the reviewer
is asking why we cannot treat the ordering "synthetically" in the same way that
we treat the step-indexing synthetically via SGDT. That is, our objects would be
treated as sets when working internally, but from an "external viewpoint" they
would be sets equipped with a partial order. This is an interesting possibility
which, as we mention in the Discussion section of the paper, we plan to explore
as future work.

* R1 why weak bisimilarity?
Reviewer 1 also asks why all of the objects in our concrete model need to come
equipped with a notion of weak bisimilarity. That is, why can't weak
bisimilarity be limited to the guarded lift monad? Tracing things back one step,
we could say that this is because the intensional model requires the vertical
hom-sets to have a notion of "weak bisimilarity", which in this abstract setting
is specified as a reflexive, symmetric relation that is closed under composition.
As was the case with the partial order discussed above, when we define the
concrete model, we need to satisfy this requirement. We do so by equipping the
*objects* with a reflexive, symmetric relation, which then extends to a relation
on the vertical hom-sets (morphisms between predomains) in the obvious way.

Of course, one could now ask, as Reviewer 1 does, why the definition of
intensional model is designed this way. The reason the definition of
intensional model requires a notion of weak bisimilarity for all vertical
hom-sets is that we need to reason about weak bisimilarity for
*higher-order* types, e.g., when we cast a function to another function,
no steps are taken at a first-order. But when the function is applied,
steps may be taken. So we need a way to lift the bisimilarity relation
to functions.

* R1 loves Agda

Reviewer 1 mentions that they would prefer if the Agda formalization
was complete.

We are planning to complete at least some portions of the results here
in guarded cubical Agda, especially the adequacy
results. Unfortunately, there is still significant effort to finish
the mechanization as a faithful rendering of the constructions in our
paper would rely on formalizations of double categories and CBPV
models, which are not readily available.

On the other hand, we would like to emphasize that we co-designed the
concrete model with the formalization in Agda and this was immensely
helpful for the authors to better understand guarded type theory and
domain theory, even without a complete mechanization.

> By the way, is this a variation of double category that appeared before in the literature?

We are not aware of a name for this variation from an existing source.

Composition is only a lax morphism because relation constructors
generally do not commute strongly strongly with relation
composition. Specifically, ->, U and F only laxly commute with our
notion of relation composition. This is already true of the action of
the function arrow on ordinary relations.

The need for natural numbers arises because when we downcast from the dynamic
type to the function type, we need to insert a θ because of the '▹' in the
function case of the dynamic type (see line 1191 in the paper). Thus, in order
for the representability properties to hold with for this downcast with respect
to the lock-step error ordering, we need to insert a delay (i.e., θ ∘ next) on
the other side of the inequality to keep both sides synchronized. The natural number
in a perturbation on lift A corresponds to the insertion of this delay. That is,
the interpretation of a perturbation (n, p_A) as an endomorphism on lift A is to
perturb A according to p_A (under the functorial action of lift), and then perform
a delay n-times.

  TODO - check
  
  This is a good point. We will mention the constraints on tick application
  in the technical background section in the revision.

> l341: Is this admissibility claim proved somewhere?

Yes, this is proven in Appendix A.
  
> l378: Can the benefit of transitivity being admissible instead of
> derivable be explained? ...

This was a bit unclearly worded: reflexivity is admissible from
congruence so we don't bother adding it as a primitive. Transitivity
is *not* admissible, and this is desired as our extensional models
(Section 5.1) do not model transitivity.

> l388: The point about upcasts and downcasts being some kinds of

Yes, the technical content of this intuition is that they are Galois
connections, which can be formulated as saying they are given
pointwise by a certain join/meet.

Yes, this argument is exactly what we had in mind.

Yes, in the sense that Definition 4.2 characterizes f up to order
equivalence.

We had considered this but didn't have any use for the more general
2-cells in modeling graduality so we used the simpler reflexive graph
categories.

This is a fair point of discussion that we hadn't previously
considered and we appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out. This is
a subtle issue so here is a concise overview of the situation:

1. Our treatment was based on the Greatest HITs paper which uses the
   (∞,1)-topos of trees as a model where this is not an issue, the
   question is if the development could be modified to be more
   portable to other guarded type theories/models.
2. In the 1-topos of trees model our definition of weak bisimilarity
   and our closure of lock-step error ordering under weak bisimilarity
   are trivial due to the combination of
   relating terms with differing numbers of steps and using propositional
   truncation.
   However the lock-step error ordering doesn't allow differing
   numbers of steps or require an existential quantifier, and has a
   non-trivial semantics even in the 1-topos model. So there is no
   issue with using posets for strong ordering, only in forcing
   notions using weak bisimilarity to be propositions.
3. We have studied this issue since the reviews and we are confident
   that allowing weak bisimilarity to be a Set rather than a Prop
   would not impact any of the results of the paper, as we only use
   them as inputs to the adequacy theorem, whose output is a
   Prop. This change would allow us to remove dependence on induction
   under clocks from Greatest HITs in the paper and corresponding
   axioms in our ongoing Agda formalization.

> line 1034-1040, this definition seems to indicate that your relations are
proof-relevant in the model. Is this the case?

We did not mean to imply that this relation was Set-valued, this was
intended to be an inductively defined proposition.

*MAX:* squash previous two answers

  TODO - check

  The main difference between TCTT and Clocked Type Theory appears to be the
  presence of the path equality of cubical type theory in the former.
  In Clocked Type Theory, the unfolding of guarded fixpoints is a definitional
  equality, whereas in the setting of TCTT this unfolding is only true up to a
  path. However, the constructions carried out in this paper work in either case,
  so everything we do in this paper should be possible in Clocked Type Theory.

  The main benefit of working in TCTT is that we have access to the nice features
  of cubical type theory, e.g., function extensionality is provable, and this
  implies extensionality results for the later type and for clocks since
  these are just Pi types.

*MAX:* squash with previous as well?
