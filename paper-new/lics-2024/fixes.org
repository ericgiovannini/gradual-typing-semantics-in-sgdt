  I know but ⊑ is also used in gradual typing so New-Licata went with
  the notation that would be clearer to gradual typing experts.

  This is the term representing a runtime type error. There is a typo
  and it should be $1 -> UB$.

  A step-0 model is a category internal to the category of CBPV models.
  We will make this clearer in the revision, possibly giving each of the
  step-i models more informative names.

**  Eric: I added the definition of a step-0 model

  This is a good point, and we are considering renaming the step-i models to be more informative.
  You are right that the main purpose of the step-n models with n≤3 is to build up in a modular
  way the final definition of an intensional model (i.e., a step-4 model), and also to allow
  for us to *construct* such a model as a sequence of smaller constructions from step-i to
  step-(i+1).

** TODO Eric: Think about renaming these.

  We will re-word this to clarify our meaning: using double categorical
  semantics for gradual type theory is not novel, what was missing from
  the prior work was an extension of the double categorical semantics
  from cartesian closed categories to CBPV models.

** Eric : Added some additional explanantion.

  Yes, on line 226 this stands for Gradual Type Theory, we will avoid
  this collision between acronyms in revisions.

  We will improve the explanation in this section, in particular we
  will emphasize that we need relations to compose, i.e., we have a
  category whose objects are the same as the objects of V_f / E_f and
  whose morphisms are the value / computation relations respectively.
  We will also clarify the discussion of universally
  left/right-representable relations.

** TODO incorporate this into the revision:
  Composition is only a lax morphism because relation constructors
  generally do not commute strongly strongly with relation
  composition. Specifically, ->, U and F only laxly commute with
  relation composition. This is already true of the action of the
  function arrow on ordinary relations, and for U and F it is because
  value type relations are composed by the ordinary relation
  composition whereas the computation type relations are composed by
  the free composition defined inductively at 1034.
