We will fix these in the revision.

This appears to be a macro-related typo, which we will fix.

It should be c.

Yes, this is notation for composition of relations, and we will make this clear
in the revision.

> line 875, what are V_e and E_e? Should they be V_r and E_r?

Yes; we will fix this.
  
> line 896, what is dyn?

dyn here means an object modeling the dynamic type, i.e., D in Definition 5.8.

I know but ⊑ is also used in gradual typing so New-Licata went with
the notation that would be clearer to gradual typing experts.
