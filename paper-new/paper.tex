\begin{abstract}
  Gradually typed programming languages, which allow for soundly
  mixing static and dynamically typed programming styles, present a
  strong challenge for metatheorists. Even the simplest sound
  gradually typed languages feature at least recursion and errors,
  with realistic languages featuring furthermore runtime allocation of
  memory locations and dynamic type tags. Further, the desired
  metatheoretic properties of gradually typed languages have become
  increasingly sophisticated: validity of type based equational
  reasoning as well as the relational property known as
  graduality. Many recent works have tackled verifying these
  properties, but the resulting mathematical developments are highly
  repetitive and tedious, with few reusable theorems persisting across
  different developments.

  In this work, we present a new denotational semantics for gradual
  typing developed using guarded domain theory. Guarded domain theory
  combines the generality of step-indexed logical relations for
  modeling advanced programming features with the modularity and
  reusability of denotational semantics. We demonstrate the
  feasibility of this approach with a model of gradually typed lambda
  calculus and prove the validity of beta-eta equality and the
  graduality theorem for the denotational model. This model should
  provide the basis for a reusable mathematical theory of gradually
  typed program semantics. Finally, a recent extension to Agda allows
  synthetic guarded domain theory to be readily mechanized in a proof
  assistant, and we formalize many of the core theorems of our
  development.
%%     We develop a denotational semantics for a simple gradually typed language
%%     that is adequate and proves the graduality theorem.
%%     %
%%     The denotational semantics is constructed using \emph{synthetic
%%     guarded domain theory} working in a type theory with a later
%%     modality and clock quantification.
%%     %
%%     This provides a remarkably simple presentation of the semantics,
%%     where gradual types are interpreted as ordinary types in our ambient
%%     type theory equipped with an ordinary preorder structure to model
%%     the error ordering.
%%     %
%%     This avoids the complexities of classical domain-theoretic models
%%     (New and Licata) or logical relations models using explicit
%%     step-indexing (New and Ahmed).
%%     %
%%     In particular, we avoid a major technical complexity of New and
%%     Ahmed that requires two logical relations to prove the graduality
%%     theorem.
  
%%     By working synthetically we can treat the domains in which gradual
%%     types are interpreted as if they were ordinary sets. This allows us
%%     to give a ``na\"ive'' presentation of gradual typing where each
%%     gradual type is modeled as a well-behaved subset of the universal
%%     domain used to model the dynamic type, and type precision is modeled
%%     as simply a subset relation.
