\subsection{Synthetic Ordering}

While the use of synthetic guarded domain theory allows us to very
conveniently work with non-well-founded recursive constructions while
abstracting away the precise details of step-indexing, we do work with
the error ordering in a mostly analytic fashion in that gradual types
are interpreted as sets equipped with an ordering relation, and all
terms must be proven to be monotone.
%
It is possible that a combination of synthetic guarded domain theory
with \emph{directed} type theory would allow for an a synthetic
treatment of the error ordering as well.
